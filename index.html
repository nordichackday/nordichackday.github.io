                    <h3>What is Nordic Hack Day?</h3>
                    <p>The Nordic Hack Day is a 24 hour innovation, programming and product development event, focusing on bringing the best talent from the technology teams at each of the Nordic public broadcasters together to give each other inspiration, and develop the best ideas across our development organisation.</p>
                    <p>The Nordic public broadcasters have a strong tradition for collaboration and coproduction. We want to continue this tradition of collaboration also on digital platforms.</p>
                    <p>We believe we have much to learn from each other, and that there is much to gain from collaborating to create new and innovative solutions.</p>
                    <p><a href="https://www.nordvision.org/">Nordvision</a> has made Nordic Hack Day possible by a financial contribution.</p>
